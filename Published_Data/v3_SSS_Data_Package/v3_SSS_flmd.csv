*Air_Press_Temp.csv,Approximately 35 days of time series data (barometric pressure; air temperature) collected using In Situ Rugged BaroTROLL sensors. The asterisk * refers to the  version number and Parent_ID. All data was removed from the day of deployment and two hours was removed from the day of retrieving the sensor. Sensors were deployed at a subset of sites; data at other sites were interpolated via a regression analysis. Each measured time point was used to create a linear regression. Measured pressure at each time point was regressed with site elevation. Pressure for the sites without a sensor was then estimated by inputting the site elevation into the resulting linear regression equation for each time point. Temperature was not estimated for sites without a sensor. ,ESS-DIVE Hydrologic Monitoring v1; ESS-DIVE CSV v1, 2022-07-25, 2022-09-01,N/A; -9999,/v3_SSS_Data_Package/Sensor_Data/BarotrollAtm/Data

*Water_Press_Temp.csv,Approximately 35 days of time series data (absolute pressure; temperature) collected using HOBO depth sensor. The asterisk * refers to the version number and Parent_ID. All data was removed from the day of deployment and two hours from the day of retrieving the sensor. One to two hours of data were also removed during sample collection because the sensor was removed to download the data. The sensor was placed back as close as possible to the original deployment location; but to account for any change in placement; an offset was applied to the data after it was redeployed. The offset was calculated by subtracting the pressure when it was removed from the pressure when it was redeployed. This resulted in the two data points being equal. Any visual sudden changes in pressure were assumed to be the sensor moving and were corrected in the same manor using an offset. Additional data was removed when the sensor was assumed to have been out of water.  ,ESS-DIVE Hydrologic Monitoring v1; ESS-DIVE CSV v1, 2022-07-25, 2022-09-01,N/A; -9999,/v3_SSS_Data_Package/Sensor_Data/DepthHOBO/Data

The asterisk * refers to the  version number and Parent_ID. Five minutes of data was removed from the beginning and end of the time series to remove any extraneous data caused by deploying or retrieving the sensor. QAQC of these data consisted of multiple steps: 1) all turbidity and chlorophyll A values less than 0 (including negative values) were changed to zero; 2) all values outside of the possible range were changed to NA; 3) outliers were identified and flagged using IQR; 4) outliers were removed prior to calculating the summary file. The possible range for each metric was informed by the sensor specifications, the physical properties, and our knowledge of the systems. Parent_ID SSS024 and SSS036 (Site_ID W20 and W10) were deployed longer (for the purpose of another study) and have approximately 20 days of time series data.

*Water_DO_Temp.csv,"Approximately 35 days of time series data (dissolved oxygen; and dissolved oxygen saturation; temperature) collected using miniDOT sensor. The asterisk * refers to the version number and Parent_ID. All data was removed from the day of deployment; the day of sample collection; and two hours from the day of retrieving the sensor due to riverbed disturbance. Additional data was removed when the sensor was assumed to have been out of water. A sensor-specific offset was applied to the dissolved oxygen data to account for sensor calibration at higher saturation. The offset was calculated by performing a bubbler test as described by the manufacturer (PME). Dissolved oxygen saturation was calculated using the Garcia & Gordon (1992) equation with miniDOT dissolved oxygen and baroTROLL absolute pressure. The absolute pressure data was interpolated using linear interpolation to account for difference in logging time intervals. When dissolved oxygen data extended beyond the time period of the pressure data, the first or last pressure value was used in the saturation calculation.
