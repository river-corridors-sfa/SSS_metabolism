#Samples have International Geo Sample Numbers (IGSNs) registered with System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR; https://www.geosamples.org/about/services#igsnregistration). This file maps between sample names and IGSNs. It conforms to the ESS-DIVE Sample ID and Metadata Reporting Format (IGSN-ESS) v1.1.0 (Damerow et al. 2020). Some information may be repeated between the field metadata file and this file. Parent_IGSN is the IGSN for each site ID. The original site ID is listed in the Locality column.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
