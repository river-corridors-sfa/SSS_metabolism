BaroExtrap_01,Data is calculated from sensor at nearest site in elevation. Sensor is deployed at the end of a short rope (2-3 feet) and hung from a tree branch as close to the sampling location as possible.
Depth_01,A time series of the average depth of the reach was created in two steps. First the average depth of the stream reach was measured via transects; sonar; or public sources. This created a reach-average depth at a single point in time. In order to convert this into a time series; we calculated a time series of depth-offsets based on a single point water pressure datalogger and a local barometric pressure logger. Barometric pressure was subtracted from absolute pressure to get water pressure; which was then converted to depth at a single-point in the stream. The difference between each single-point depth time series measurement and the single-point depth at the reference time (time at which reach depth was measured via transect; sonar; or public sources) was used as the depth offset. This offset for the single-point depth was added to the average stream reach depth to create the time series.
ManualChamberDark_02,Open channel respiration is estimated by deploying triplicate two liter dark bottle incubations in brown Nalgene bottles for 90 minutes at each site. First; a 20-minute equilibration period is set up by rinising two liter bottles three times with river water; submerging them; filling with river water; and then capping underwater to prevent water bubbles from entering the bottles. Sensors; bottles; and boat motors are then placed in the river and secured using bricks or larger rocks nearby for the equilibration period. Following the equilibration period; the bottles were emptied; refilled with river water and; while still submerged; a miniDOT Logger and a small boat motor is inserted in each of three two liter bottles. The bottles are then capped and placed in the river and secured using bricks or larger rocks nearby for 70 minutes.
Minidot_03,Sensor is deployed with a copper kit installed to minimize biofilm colonization on the sensor window. Sensor is attached to two bricks along with a HOBO depth sensor and deployed on the riverbed.
Minidot_04,Sensor is deployed with a copper kit and miniWIPER assembly installed to minimize biofilm colonization. miniWIPER was programmed to wipe the sensor window evey 12 hours. Sensor with a miniWIPER attached was secured to two bricks along with HOBO sensor and deployed on the riverbed.
TreeRope_01,Sensor is deployed at the end of a short rope (2-3 feet) and hung from a tree branch as close to the sampling location as possible.
