IC_Method_QA_QC,DTL_000,MethodID_DataProcessing,"Individual data cells contain sample concentration and a flag if the concentration measured was outside of the standard curve or below the limit of detection (LOD). Values for the maximum or minimum standard concentration or the limit of detection are contained in the data cell as part of the flag text. Example: ""Bromide_0.00585_ppm_Below_LOD_0.026_ppm"" means that the Bromide concentration was 0.00585 milligrams_per_liter (ppm) which was below the 0.026 milligrams_per_liter (ppm) limit of detection.",N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) - Richland

Data_Status,ready_to_use,N/A,The data have been evaluated and are ready to use.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) - Richland
COT_Typical,COT_T_IN_000,MethodID_Inspection,Cotton strips were whole prior to deployment; remained in the same submerged position during deployment; and all reps from each site appeared similar unless otherwise noted when they were retrieved from the field.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
COT_Typical,COT_T_ST_000,MethodID_Storage,Cotton strips were retrieved from the field and kept on wet ice until transported to PNNL- Richland campus. The cotton strips were kept at room temperature after drying and during transport to Oakland University. ,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
COT_Typical,COT_T_PRES_000,MethodID_Preservation,Cotton strips were preserved in 70 percent ethanol in the field and remained in ethanol until dried in the lab. ,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
COT_Typical,COT_T_PREP_000,MethodID_Preparation,Cotton strips were retrieved from each location; removed from the tea infuser/brick setup; and lightly rinsed with river water to remove large particulates. The four cotton strips from the site were stacked on top of each other and placed into a tube with 70 percent ethanol; rinsed and kept in ethanol. In the lab; the tubes were drained of any remaining ethanol; left uncapped; and dried at 40degC. Once dried; the tubes were re-capped and sent to Oakland University.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
COT_Typical,COT_T_AN_000,MethodID_Analysis,Following the protocol in Tiegs et al.; 2013 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.03.013); approximately 1 centimeter-long portions of the ends of each strip were placed in the grips (Checkline brand; Model #G1008) of a tensiometer (Mark-10 brand; Model #MG100) mounted on a motorized teststand (Chantillon TCM 201). The grips were sufficiently tight to ensure that the strips did not slip during the pulling process; but not so tight as to tear the strips at their point of contact with the grips; and were lined with cotton-based tape to prevent slippage. Strips were pulled at a fixed rate of 2 centimeters_per_minute and maximum tensile strength was recorded for each strip in units of pounds of force. ,Mark-10 #MG100,Oakland University
COT_Typical,COT_T_DP_000,MethodID_DataProcessing,Tensile strength was converted to decay rate; with units of decay per day; following Mancuso et al. (2022; https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4202). Mean tensile strength of ten reference strips was 67.3 with a standard deviation of 0.92. ,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
