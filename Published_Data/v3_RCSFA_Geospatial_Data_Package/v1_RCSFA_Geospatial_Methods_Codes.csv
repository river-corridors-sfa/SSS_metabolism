COMID_Method,COMID_Analysis_00,MethodID_Analysis,Locations for each site were collected by field teams using a variety of GPS technologies. Each site’s location was matched with the nearest NHDPlus Version 2 (NHDPlusV2; https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/get-nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus-data) network streamline using the NNJoin nearest-neighbor spatial join plugin (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/NNJoin/) for QGIS (QGIS Geographic Information System. QGIS Association. http://www.qgis.org). Stream lines are identified in NHDPlusV2 by a unique common-ID or COMID. The COMID identified by the nearest-neighbor spatial join is referred to here as the raw COMID. Join results (raw COMIDs) were manually reviewed by personnel familiar with the sites. One key review criterion was whether or not the stream name from the site metadata matched the stream name from NHPPlusV2. In situations where the nearest-neighbor spatial join did not identify the correct stream the correct stream line was manually identified (if possible) and a rectified COMID was extracted.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_Method,COMID_Analysis_01,MethodID_Analysis,Locations for each site were collected by field teams using a variety of GPS technologies. Each site’s location was matched with the nearest NHDPlus Version 2 (NHDPlusV2; https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/get-nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus-data) network streamline using R. The R script can be found at https://github.com/river-corridors-sfa/Geospatial_variables/blob/71149dc0623a5a4c28458e215a3c06e01d0169c7/Example_Code/geospatial_workflow_check_comids.Rmd.

COMID_Method,COMID_00,MethodID_Analysis,The name of the stream from the metadata and the name of the stream from NHDPlusV2 matched. The site WAS manually confirmed by someone with knowledge of the site.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_Method,COMID_01,MethodID_Analysis,The name of the stream from the metadata and the name of the stream from NHDPlusV2 matched. The site WAS NOT manually confirmed by someone with knowledge of the site.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_Method,COMID_02,MethodID_Analysis,The name of the stream from the metadata and the name of the stream in NHDPlusV2 did not match. We manually checked and it appears that the correct COMID was identified by nearest-neighbor join. This was usually caused by extra information being included in the stream name metadata field.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_DEVIATION,COMID_03,MethodID_Analysis,The correct COMID is in NHDPlusV2 non-network dataset. This may have implications for analysis.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_DEVIATION,COMID_04,MethodID_Analysis,It is impossible to determine conclusively if the raw COMID is correct or not (usually because NHDPlusV2 does not have stream names for more than one possible option; or there is a name mismatch but the location and match otherwise look correct).,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_DEVIATION,COMID_05,MethodID_Analysis,The site is located on the correct stream; however there is some uncertainty about site location relative to a confluence or other potentially significant hydrological feature.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_DEVIATION,COMID_06,MethodID_Analysis,Manually reviewed location and changed the COMID because the nearest-neighbor join had identified the wrong stream and/or COMID.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_DEVIATION,COMID_07,MethodID_Analysis,Manually reviewed location but were unable to identify the correct stream. It is likely that the stream does not exist in the NHDPlusV2 database.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
COMID_DEVIATION,COMID_08,MethodID_Analysis,The site is not within the continental US; so there is no NHDPlusV2 COMID associated with it.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
DATA_FLAG,FLAG_00,MethodID_Analysis,"The raw COMID identified by nearest-neighbor spatial join was incorrect and a manually selected (""rectified"") COMID is used instead. For traceability purposes the incorrect raw COMID is included in the Methods_and_Flags column in a data flag with the following format: RawCOMID_[raw_COMID].",N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)
