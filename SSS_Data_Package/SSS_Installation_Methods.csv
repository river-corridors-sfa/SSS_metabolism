InstallationMethod_ID,InstallationMethod_Description
BaroExtrap_01,Data is calculated from sensor at nearest site in elevation. Sensor is deployed at the end of a short rope (2-3 feet) and hung from a tree branch as close to the sampling location as possible. 
DepthHobo_01,Sensor is secured to two bricks along with miniDOT sensor and deployed on the riverbed.
ManualChamberDark_02,Open channel respiration is estimated by deploying triplicate two liter dark bottle incubations in brown Nalgene bottles for 90 minutes at each site. First; a 20-minute equilibration period is set up by rinsing two liter bottles three times with river water; submerging them; filling with river water; and then capping underwater to prevent water bubbles from entering the bottles. Sensors; bottles; and boat motors are then placed in the river and secured using bricks or larger rocks nearby for the equilibration period. Following the equilibration period; the bottles were emptied; refilled with river water and; while still submerged; a miniDOT Logger and a small boat motor is inserted in each of three two liter bottles. The bottles are then capped and placed in the river and secured using bricks or larger rocks nearby for 70 minutes.
Minidot_03,Sensor is deployed with a copper kit installed to minimize biofilm colonization on the sensor window. Sensor is attached to two bricks along with a HOBO depth sensor and deployed on the riverbed. 
Minidot_04,Sensor is deployed with a copper kit and miniWIPER assembly installed to minimize biofilm colonization. miniWIPER was programmed to wipe the sensor window every 12 hours. Sensor with a miniWIPER attached was secured to two bricks along with HOBO sensor and deployed on the riverbed.
Pipe_Kit_02,Sensor is deployed inside a protective pipe kit and placed on the riverbed as close to the thalweg as possible depending on river depth and access to the shoreline.
PublicDepth_01,Width and depth were determined from a rating curve from the State of Washington's Department of Ecology (https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/publications/SummaryPages/1803009.html) and daily average flow from United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) gauge ID NACW (https://www.usbr.gov/pn-bin/yak/dfcgi.pl?sta=NACW) on 2022-07-26.
PublicDepth_02,Width and depth were determined from a rating curve from USGS gauge data and gauge-reported flow at Union Gap at the indicated date and time (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?agency_code=USGS&site_no=12500450)
Sonar_01,Lowrance HDS7 Live fish finder with active imaging 3 in 1 transducer is mounted to the bottom of a fishing-style kayak.
Sonar_02,Lowrance HDS7 Live fish finder with active imaging 3 in 1 transducer is mounted to the bottom of a jet boat.
SonarDepth_01,Point measurements were measured via Lowrance HDS7 Live fish finder with active imaging 3 in 1 transducer mounted to the bottom of a fishing-style kayak. Width was calculated by averaging at least 5 width estimates from sonar map. See Sonar folder for full data set. 
SonarDepth_02,Point measurements were measured via Lowrance HDS7 Live fish finder with active imaging 3 in 1 transducer mounted to the bottom of a jet boat. The data was collected on 2021-11-22 and adjusted to 2022-07-25. Width was calculated by averaging at least 5 width estimates from sonar map.  See Sonar folder for full data set. 
TreeRope_01,Sensor is deployed at the end of a short rope (2-3 feet) and hung from a tree branch as close to the sampling location as possible.
WadingDepth_01,Manual measurements were taken along a transect using a measurement stick marked with metric units. See SSS_Field_Protocol.csv for more details. Distance; width; and depth were determined by averaging the values. See SSS_Transect_Depth.csv for full data set. 
WaterColumn_Handheld,Handheld sensor is held below the surface of the water to equilibrate. Following equilibration; water column samples are collected by dipping the instrument below the water surface to fill the cup and then manually recording parameter values. Three replicate samples are collected one after the other at each site.
